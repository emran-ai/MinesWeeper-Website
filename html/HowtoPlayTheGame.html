    <h2>Minesweeper </h2>

    <h3><strong>The objective in Minesweeper:</strong></h3> Finding and marking all the mines hidden under the grey
    squares,in the shortest time possible.</h2><br>
    <h2><strong>How?</strong></h2>
    <br>This is done<em> by clicking on the squares </em>to open them. Each
    square will have one of the following:<br><br><br>
    <!-- Ol gives ordered lists with numbers but ul it has no order -->
    <!--  <ol>
          <li><strong>A mine:</strong>if you click on it, you'll lose the game.</li>
          <li><strong>A number:</strong> which tells you how many of its adjacent squares have mines in them.</li>
          <li><strong>Nothing:</strong> In this case you know that none of the adjacent squares have mines, and they
              will be
              automatically opened as well.</strong>
          </li>
      </ol>!-->
    <!--if you want to give a definition and a list of data or items use dd/dt/dl!-->
    <!-- <dl>
         <dt><strong>1.A mine:</strong>
         <dd>if you click on it, you'll lose the game.</dd>
         <dt><strong>2.A number:</strong>
         <dd>which tells you how many of its adjacent squares have mines in them.</dd>
         <dt><strong> 3.Nothing</strong></dt>
         <dd>In this case you know that none of the adjacent squares have mines, and they will be
             automatically opened as well.
         </dd></dl>   !-->

    <strong>Attention:</strong> It is guaranteed that the first square you open won't contain a mine, so you can start
    by clicking any square.
    Often you'll hit on an empty square on the first try ,and then you'll open up a few adjacent squares as well,
    which makes it easier to continue. Then it's basically just looking at the numbers shown, and figuring out where
    the mines are.,

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>There are essentially five actions you can take in Minesweeper:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Open a square:</strong><em> This is done simply by left clicking on a square.</em><br><br>
        <li><strong>Marking a square as a mine: </strong><em>This is done by right clicking on a square. A little mine
            icon will show up
            there.</em><br><br>
        <li><strong>Marking a square with a question mark:</strong> This is done by right-click twice on a square</em>,
            or right-click once on a square that's already marked as a mine.
            Question marks are useful to mark squares you're not absolutely sure are mines, but want to make sure
            you don't accidentally open them.</em><br><br></li>
        <li><strong>Clear any marks. Again, right-click on the square:</strong> <em>Right-click cycles through the
            following states:
            Bomb, Question Mark, Clear.</em><br><br>
        <li><strong>Opening all remaining adjacent squares to a number square:</strong><em> If for example you
            have a square with the number 1 and you have already marked one mine in
            one of the adjacent squares you can left click on the 1 square and the remaining adjacent squares will
            all be opened.
            This can save a lot of time while trying to quickly clear out squares.
            If you press on a number where not all adjacent mines have been marked, e.g. the number is 3 and you've
            only
            flagged one adjacent square, then the squares will not be opened, to prevent
            you from accidentally clicking on a number and blowing yourself up.</em>
        </li>
    </ol>
